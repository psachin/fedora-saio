* fedora-saio

  Swift All In One on Fedora(Vagrant =libvirt= provider)

  Deployment screencast: [[https://asciinema.org/a/94335][https://asciinema.org/a/94335]]

** Install dependencies

   #+BEGIN_SRC sh
     # Install vagrant-libvirt dependency packages
     $ sudo dnf install @vagrant
     $ sudo dnf install vagrant-libvirt

     # Make sure you enable libvirt daemon
     $ sudo systemctl enable libvirtd
     $ sudo systemctl start libvirtd

     # Make sure you enable virtlogd daemon
     $ sudo systemctl enable virtlogd
     $ sudo systemctl start virtlogd
   #+END_SRC

** Add user to =libvirt= group

   #+BEGIN_SRC sh
     $ sudo usermod -G libvirt -a <USERNAME>
   #+END_SRC

** Provision

   - Start domain

	 #+BEGIN_SRC sh
       vagrant up
     #+END_SRC

   - SSH to fedoraSaio domain

     #+BEGIN_SRC sh
       vagrant ssh
     #+END_SRC

** Start swift

   - Initialize swift object, container & account server
	 #+BEGIN_SRC sh
       sudo swift-init main start
     #+END_SRC

   - Start other server namely =updater=, =replication=, =auditor=
	 #+BEGIN_SRC sh
       sudo swift-init rest start;
	 #+END_SRC

   Swift proxy server should be running at =192.168.11.33:8080=

*** Dispersion report

   - In order to dispersion report, run

	 #+BEGIN_SRC sh
       swift-dispersion-populate
	 #+END_SRC

   - Sample output

	 #+BEGIN_SRC sh
       $ swift-dispersion-report
       Using storage policy: gold
       Queried 10 containers for dispersion reporting, 0s, 0 retries
       100.00% of container copies found (50 of 50)
       Sample represents 0.98% of the container partition space
       Queried 10 objects for dispersion reporting, 0s, 0 retries
       There were 10 partitions missing 0 copies.
       100.00% of object copies found (30 of 30)
       Sample represents 0.98% of the object partition space
	 #+END_SRC

** Troubleshooting

   - You may need to change =:adapter= value in =Vagrantfile=

** Multi-cluster
   - Both swift proxy services and memcached services should be
     running on proxy server node
